## Context

`CommuniK` is a project built in five days. This is the last solo project of the third Module of Turing School Software and Design that aims to solidify the use of React, Router and Asynchronomus JavaScript. The main goal in this project were the ability to request information from an [API](https://developer.nytimes.com/), manipulate the data and display it using React. 

#### Technologies used:

  * React
  * Express
  * SCSS
  * Git
  * GitHub
  * local storage

## Challenges

  * Manipulating state using objects
  * File organizations
  * Compoenents arquitecture
  * Testing with jest

## Wins

  * Unit testing
  * Integration testing
  * Mocking an API request
  * Saving data to local storage

## Future Goals

  * Resolve bugs listed on the project board
  * Add more styling
  * Add more granuluar integration testing
  * Build a local server using Express
  * Add the ability to submit you own article
  * Find more information using other APIS such as [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything)

#### Take 3

- Search by date

There is another way for the user to find stories.This can be accomplised by using the `search-by-date` bar. The user should write a date in the following formats, `MM-DDYYYY` or `MM-DD-YYYY`.

#### Take 4

- Saving stories to read for later

- When the user has found an article to read but does not have the time to engage with the story, it the user can select the story and read it later. The stories should persist even if the user reloads the page.
